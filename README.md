# VoiceTouch

Full size Behringer X-Touch integration with VoiceMeeter Potato

Currently only simple features are implemented


Use Inputs and Buses buttons to switch what you are controlling, the record button currently resets the channel gain this will probably be changed later.

Any questions? write to me on discord: "viwas"
