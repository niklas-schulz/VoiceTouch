Behringer X-Touch integration with VoiceMeeter Potato

Currently only simple features are implemented

Support for the Full size, Extender and Compact(only in MC mode) versions


For extender standalone mode channel 7 and 8 select changes between inputs and buses

Config.json can be edited to change the keymap the number represents the first button in the row if it's a multichannel button type, the button numbers can be seen in the log.
